.SH NAME
.B afl-showmap

.SH SYNOPSIS
afl-showmap [ options ] -- /path/to/target_app [ ... ]

.SH OPTIONS
.nf

Required parameters:
  -o file    - file to write the trace data to

Execution control settings:
  -t msec    - timeout for each run (none)
  -m megs    - memory limit for child process (0 MB)
  -O         - use binary-only instrumentation (FRIDA mode)
  -Q         - use binary-only instrumentation (QEMU mode)
  -U         - use Unicorn-based instrumentation (Unicorn mode)
  -W         - use qemu-based instrumentation with Wine (Wine mode)
               (Not necessary, here for consistency with other afl-* tools)

Other settings:
  -i dir     - process all files below this directory, must be combined with -o.
               With -C, -o is a file, without -C it must be a directory
               and each bitmap will be written there individually.
  -C         - collect coverage, writes all edges to -o and gives a summary
               Must be combined with -i.
  -q         - sink program's output and don't show messages
  -e         - show edge coverage only, ignore hit counts
  -r         - show real tuple values instead of AFL filter values
  -s         - do not classify the map
  -c         - allow core dumps

This tool displays raw tuple data captured by AFL instrumentation.
For additional help, consult /usr/local/share/doc/afl/README.md.

Environment variables used:
LD_BIND_LAZY: do not set LD_BIND_NOW env var for target
AFL_CMIN_CRASHES_ONLY: (cmin_mode) only write tuples for crashing inputs
AFL_CMIN_ALLOW_ANY: (cmin_mode) write tuples for crashing inputs also
AFL_CRASH_EXITCODE: optional child exit code to be interpreted as crash
AFL_DEBUG: enable extra developer output
AFL_FORKSRV_INIT_TMOUT: time spent waiting for forkserver during startup (in milliseconds)
AFL_KILL_SIGNAL: Signal ID delivered to child processes on timeout, etc. (default: SIGKILL)
AFL_MAP_SIZE: the shared memory size for that target. must be >= the size the target was compiled for
AFL_PRELOAD: LD_PRELOAD / DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES settings for target
AFL_PRINT_FILENAMES: If set, the filename currently processed will be printed to stdout
AFL_QUIET: do not print extra informational output
AFL_NO_FORKSRV: run target via execve instead of using the forkserver
